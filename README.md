CodeBasedUI
===========

This is a sample project to show how to build a Swift iOS project and use source code to manage your UI instead of Story Board.

If you build this project and run it on your iOS device, a text label that shows "Hello World!" should be displayed right at the center of your screen, no matter which iOS device you use.
